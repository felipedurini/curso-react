Clothing e-commerce made with React JS

Libraries I used:

React Bootstrap : To create most of my project's infrastructure.
React icons : Used for the CartWidget icon.
Firebase : To create the database in which I stored and then fetched the products. Also used it to store the users' buy orders.
SweetAlert : To create more user friendly, nice and tidier alerts.
React loader : To create the loader.
